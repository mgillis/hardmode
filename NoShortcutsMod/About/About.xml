    - "New Colony Optimism" has been replaced by adrenaline. It wears off faster.
    - You can cook on campfires, which have been moved to the Production tab.
    - It's very, very dark at night. You probably want to build that campfire first thing.
    - Mining is a technology. You can't mine until you've researched it.
